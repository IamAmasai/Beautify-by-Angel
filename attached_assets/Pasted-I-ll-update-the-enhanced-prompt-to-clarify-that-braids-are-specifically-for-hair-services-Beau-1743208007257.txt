I'll update the enhanced prompt to clarify that braids are specifically for hair services:

# Beauty Service Booking System Requirements

## Client Booking Flow
1. The client navigates to the packages section
2. Client selects desired services with base price from package options
3. Client chooses between:
   - In-store service (no additional cost)
   - Home service (additional 200 KSh added automatically)
4. For hair services with braids, client chooses between:
   - Using their own braids (cost: 0 KSh extra) OR
   - Purchasing braids from us (70 KSh per braid)
     - Client selects quantity of braids
     - System automatically adds this cost to the total
5. Any other additional services are added to the total price
6. Complete total price is displayed clearly in KSh on the client's screen
7. System shows message: "Booking confirms acceptance of price and policy"
8. Client completes booking

## Pricing Structure
- Base price: Selected from packages and pricing list
- Home service: +200 KSh
- For hair braiding services:
  - Client's own braids: +0 KSh
  - Our braids: +70 KSh per braid (quantity selected by client)
- Other additional services priced according to the template

## Service Selection Features
- Allow clients to select from multiple style options for:
  - Henna designs
  - Makeup styles
  - Hair services (including braiding options)
  - Nail designs
- Import style options from the internet where our catalog lacks options
- Price according to the template provided in KSh

## Availability Management System
- Create an admin panel for the business owner to:
  - Set available and unavailable time slots
  - Update availability in real-time
- Ensure the availability system:
  - Displays open time slots to clients
  - Marks slots as "taken" once booked
  - Prevents double-booking of the same time slot

The system should calculate and display the total cost progressively as clients make selections, with all pricing in Kenyan Shillings (KSh).
