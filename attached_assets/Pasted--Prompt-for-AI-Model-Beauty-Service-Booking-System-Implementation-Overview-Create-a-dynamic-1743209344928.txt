# Prompt for AI Model: Beauty Service Booking System Implementation

## Overview
Create a dynamic booking system for a beauty salon offering multiple services including hair braiding, henna, nails, and makeup. The system should calculate prices in real-time based on client selections and display a clear summary before booking confirmation.

## Detailed Requirements

### General Booking Flow
1. Client selects initial service category (hair braiding, henna, nails, or makeup)
2. System displays base price for selected service (e.g., 1000 KSh for hair braiding)
3. Client is presented with a form to customize their service
4. As client makes selections, the total price updates automatically and remains visible
5. At the bottom of the form, display a red message stating: "Booking confirms acceptance of prices and policy"
6. Client completes booking by clicking "Book Now" button

### Hair Braiding Service Options
- Base price: 1000 KSh (or as set in the system)
- Location option:
  - In-salon (no additional cost)
  - Home service (+200 KSh)
- Braid materials option:
  - Client provides own braids (no additional cost)
  - Purchase braids from salon (70 KSh per braid)
    - Include quantity selector (e.g., dropdown or number input)
    - Automatically calculate and add cost based on quantity selected

### Additional Service Categories
Implement similar customization forms for:
- Henna designs
- Nail services
- Makeup application

Each service should:
- Display appropriate base price
- Offer home service option (+200 KSh)
- Include service-specific customizations
- Calculate and display running total

### Price Calculation Logic
- Start with base price from selected package
- Add 200 KSh if home service is selected
- For hair braiding with salon-provided materials: add (70 KSh Ã— number of braids)
- Add costs of any other selected options
- Display running total prominently throughout the selection process

### User Interface Elements
- Clear service category selection buttons/cards
- Toggle switches for binary options (home/salon, own/our braids)
- Numeric input for braid quantity (if applicable)
- Real-time price calculator with visible running total
- Red confirmation message: "Booking confirms acceptance of prices and policy"
- Prominent "Book Now" button
- Confirmation screen after successful booking

### Owner's Availability Management
- Create an admin panel where the owner can:
  - Set available and unavailable time slots
  - Block off certain days/times
  - View and manage bookings
- Ensure time slots are synchronized in real-time
- Prevent double-booking by marking booked slots as unavailable to other clients

## Implementation Notes
- Use real-time validation for all form inputs
- Ensure all pricing calculations happen client-side for immediate feedback
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop users
- Use clear visual indicators when prices change
- Store booking data securely in the database
- Send confirmation notifications to both client and salon owner
